# Session 1 {#s1}

## CCS Module

-   *Computational Communication Science* is mostly
    -   introduction to basic literature and methods
    -   very practical exercises in computational methods
-   *Datafied Society* is more
    -   theory and research-focused
    -   (and probably has a unifying topic)
-   Write your term paper in either of the classes.

## Course credit and requirements

-   active participation, i.e. by presenting a poster on a CCS study
-   smaller homework assignments, i.e. practical computational methods
-   term paper, preferably a data-driven analysis of your choice
    -   either as traditional 3000 word research paper or
    -   alternative forms, e.g. [Scrollytelling](https://posit.co/blog/closeread-prize-winners/)
    -   fantastic example (in German): [Blaue Bücher, rosa Bücher](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/kultur/gender-wie-gleichberechtigt-sind-kinderbuecher-e970817/)
-   team work (in small teams) is more fun ad highly encouraged

## English

-   English is used for **all** spoken and written communication in the module
-   English proficiency is never judged or graded
-   the core difficulties in understanding the literature are rarely language-related
-   CCS is almost exclusively based on English publications, with two notable intro book exceptions: @jünger2023; @haim2023

## Computational Communication Science?

> A field is emerging that leverages the capacity to collect and analyze data at a scale that may reveal patterns of individual and group behaviors. [@lazerpentland2009]

> \[W\]e define computational communication science as the endeavor to understand human communication by developing and applying digital tools that often involve a high degree of automation in observational, theoretical, and experimental research. [@hilbertbarnett2019]

## Computational Communication Science

-   definition based on methods rather than study subject or theoretical background
-   somehow "big data" are involved, as are automatic methods
-   terminology and many methods mostly derived from the natural sciences and engineering
-   innovation often (but not always) happens outside academia, e.g. within companies such as Google or Meta

## Computational methods

-   the "Big 3" approaches in CCS:
    1.  automatic content analysis
    2.  analysis of digital traces and digital behavioral data
    3.  simulation and agent-based modelling
-   historically, *very* strong emphasis on web data and automatic content analysis [@vanatteveldt2022computational]
-   agent-based modeling still very niche topics (see your own study choices for next week!)

## Schedule

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
plan <- readr::read_tsv("plan.tsv") |> 
  dplyr::rename(Session = Sitzung, Date = Datum, Topic = Thema)
knitr::kable(plan)
```

## Challenges

-   data access for academic research [@freelon2018]
-   legal and ethical challenges in using private or semi-public data
-   technical and methodological issues in analyzing very large datasets
-   necessary skills for students and scholars, lack of curricula
-   computational studies are often (by necessity) interdisciplinary
-   also: literacy for reviewing computational studies in communication research

## Caveats

-   the field is moving extremely fast, that means
    -   many approaches are outdated within a few years
    -   platforms restrict access to data and prohibit distribution of replication data
    -   replication of many studies is difficult
-   starting from methods or data feels strange (and for some uncomfortable) compared to traditional empirical research
-   you will need (and learn) coding skills at least in R, but might need Python later

## Benefits

-   computational skills are **extremely** valuable on the job market, both in academia and in the real world
-   the CCS perspective challenges many traditional assumptions about how research works, i.e. by valuing creative re-operationalization of existing measures
-   with a full methods toolbox, you can conduct high-quality research even on niche topics
-   ideally the course will help you conduct better studies in your large empirical modules

## Course setup

-   "cold opening" introduction by actually reading CCS papers
-   then, for every approach:
    -   I prepare a small presentation on the basics
    -   you work through an application using R at home
    -   we discuss the practical tasks in the following session
    -   we creatively apply the new methods to our own topics
-   Bring your own ideas, data, research questions to class!

## CCS Paper Potpourri

-   10 posters overall, we'll probably do 2x 45min sessions.
-   please bring the digital versions as well, just in case
-   remember to get the posters printed ASAP
-   any questions about the studies or posters?

# Questions?

# Session 2 {#s2}

## CCS Paper Potpourri

-   2x 30 minutes/5 papers in the hallway
-   presenters:
    -   think of a 30 second summary pitch to get the conversation started
    -   note/remember questions that came up repeatedly or were noteworthy
-   audience
    -   provide interactions on the poster site (in English)!
    -   note/remember questions you'd like to discuss in class

## Discussion

1.  Which paper/study do you remember best (and why)?
2.  Which study was the most difficult to understand (and why)?
3.  Which study would you like to replicate?

## Next week

1.  Read @salganik2018, Chapter 6 and @freelon2018.
2.  Read about (at least skim the posts) the very recent Reddit/AI experiment issue:
    -   [summary article](https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/28/experiment-using-ai-generated-posts-on-reddit-draws-fire-for-ethics-concerns/) and [follow up](https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/29/ethics-committee-ai-llm-reddit-changemyview-university-zurich/)
    -   [original thread on Reddit](%3Chttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k8b2hj/meta_unauthorized_experiment_on_cmv_involving)

# Session 3 {#s3}

## @salganik2018 I

![](images/sal61.png)

## @salganik2018 I

-   What are the main differences between Consequentialism and Deontology?
-   How can the four mentioned ethical principles be applied to the experiment run by @munger2017?
-   In case of doubt, what priority should these principles have among themselves?

## @salganik2018 II

## Research Ethics in Practice

-   Is informed consent needed for a content analysis of social media posts from members parliament?
-   What about comments on posts or public pages, e.g., from parties or politicians?
-   What about Tinder profiles or other online dating platforms?
-   What if informed consent is practically not possible?

## Group Task

(four groups, 10 minutes)

1.  Summarise the design and execution of the Reddit AI experiment.
2.  What were the main points of criticism from the Reddit mods/legal people?
3.  What were the main rebuttals from the researcher team and UZH?
4.  Can you salvage the study idea and run it ethically? How?

## API and non-API access

-   free model (e.g. Wikipedia): everyone can get the data
-   paid model (e.g. Twitter/X): you pay the platform or a third party for access
-   grant model (e.g. TikTok): you can apply for access to the API as a scholar
-   collab model (e.g. Meta): you can work with the platforms on spefific research questions
-   data donation model: you ask participants to donate their DDP (Data Download Packages)
-   independent/rogue model: you access a secret API or scrape the data otherwise

## Post-API era

-   most models have failed due to platforms (change of) self-interests [@freelon2018]
    -   commercial interests (i.e. monetization) or concerns about bad PR
    -   privacy concerns for well-meaning platforms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize>
    -   "research data" incomplete and at times worse than public data
-   big collaborations like [Social Science One](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/funders-are-ready-to-pull-out-of-facebooks-academic-data) failed miserably and publicly
-   other were challenging [@wagner2023] and ultimately problematic [@bagchi2024]

## Issues with online data

- not all available online data can/should be considered public
- privacy vs. reproducibility vs. ethics vs. legal questions
- many instances of well-meaning research with unethically obtained data
- many instances of unethical research 
- second and third order effects, e.g. LLM training data or vision models
- plus biases, errors, etc.

## Questions

- When can you scrape and use online data (against the platforms terms)?
- Can you use an AI model based on unethical, possibly illegal training data?
- How can you ensure reproducible findings with problematic data?
